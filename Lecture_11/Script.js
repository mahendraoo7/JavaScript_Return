/*  CALLBACK PROMISES AND ASYNC-AWAIT 

//  Synchronous
  ->  code Exicut Line by Line 

  
//  Asynchronous
   ->   Sometimes code line delay but js go next line and exicutes to say asynchronous


 // CallBack
       -> in funciton another function pass as argument


 //  CallBack Hell
      -> Nested callback , callback in callback

  

 // Promises
    ->promises is for "eventual" completion of task. 
    ->it is object in js.   
    ->it is an Solution of hell

    promises have to hanlder (resolve and reject )




//  Promises  :

    Pending : result is undefined       
    Resolve : result value is fullfiled 
    reject  : result is an Error object  

// Promise Chain

  .then()  -> print when promises resolve
  .catch()  -> print when promises reject




//   Async - Await 

   -Async 
   -> async function A always return a promise

    -Await 
    -> await pause the exicution of its surronding async function until the promise is settled.
    -> await is using only in async funtion


    //  IIFE  : immediatly Invoked Function Expression
    -> it can use only one time 
    -> it exicute immidetly
    -> if use it secound time to do copy.
